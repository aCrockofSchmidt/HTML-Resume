        <h1>A Little Bit About Me</h1>
        <hr/>

        <p>Here’s the thing about that grand plan you had for your career. Fate will take one look at it and laugh in your face.
           The key is to let Fate have its laugh, smirk ever so slightly, and rejig your plan to fit your new narrative.
           After all, to quote a famous warrior, “It’s just a flesh wound.”</p>

        <p>I’ve been rejigging my plan for more than two decades, reinventing myself as required,
           all while keeping Fate scrambling to do its worst. That adventure now has my sights set on the world of technology.</p>

        <p>My first concerted effort to redirect my career into the technology industry, was through participation in the
           Bow Valley College Tech Skills Initiative. The goal of this program was to retrain former oil and gas workers for new
           careers in data analytics and business intelligence.</p>

        <p>I gained certifications in MS Excel, MS SQL Server, IBM SPSS and IBM Cognos while also getting my first taste of tech work
           during a short but productive practicum at a local fantasy sports start-up. I've since complimented this education with
           self-study in Python as well as exploring alternatives to software programs taught in the program, such as MS Power BI and Tableau.</p>

        <p>Being thrust out of my comfort zone after a hiatus, this new challenge has reignited my passion for learning.
           Applying old tools to new puzzles has been rewarding and insightful. In a world where solutions are but a deft
           online search away, my honed research skills have supported my education well.</p>

        <p>Working both independently and as a key member of a diversified team, I have contributed not only to my own success
           but that of my classmates. I am thorough, reliable, ethical, and pride myself on being so. I retain a youthful curiosity
           but temper it with seasoned practicality.</p>

        <p>Mine has not been a typical career path but nonetheless has provided me talents applicable to my tech career goals.
           It began in the environmental field as a junior hydrogeologist conducting field work, interpreting laboratory data,
           and writing client reports. Next came a move to Calgary and the inevitable oil patch job where I flourished applying
           my hydrogeological knowledge to petroleum geology. I acquired a diverse skill set under the tutelage of several terrific mentors,
           progressing to the point of mentoring a summer student myself.</p>

        <p>I worked at super-majors through micro-juniors, learning the unique financial, operational, and management challenges
           of each. I continually developed skills in manipulating and analyzing complex data and regularly adapted
           to the new technologies enhancing and disrupting the geological profession.</p>

        <p>The next stop on my journey through adulthood was a big one. I turned focus to my personal life, embracing the role of stay-at-home dad,
           acting as primary caregiver and homemaker for my family of four. Encompassing the full gamut of parenting demands, I furthered my
           understanding of the importance of negotiation, organization, and patience.</p>

        <p>Kids age, of course, and with that comes increased free time. Again, I transformed, building on my pre-existing
           writing skills, first as a contract environmental report writer/editor, then as a personal blogger.
           With annual growth in readership, my blog has furthered my storytelling skills and taught me basic knowledge of WordPress,
           HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Blogging, in turn, opened doors to freelance and technical writing. I continue to successfully pitch articles
           to several print and online magazines, and I completed a contract with the digital team at a tax preparation
           company creating text for software under development, writing/editing help articles, and performing online customer service.</p>

        <p>These tentative steps into the periphery of the tech industry, including a foray into online map and data analysis,
           encouraged me to embrace my latest reincarnation. Being a blogger, web development seemed a logical next step. And that practicum certainly
           piqued my interest in coding and creativity it involves. I’m ready to meld my skillsets, old and new, and begin this next
           exciting leg of my reinvention.</p>
